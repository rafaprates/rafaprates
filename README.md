# Hello ğŸ‘‹

I have recently graduated from Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering. During graduation, I have had experience developing small Django systems and a Flutter mobile front-end. Currently, I work as PLC/Supervisory system programmer. My objective is to pursue a career in software development, specially building back-end/fullstack systems.
